            <p>Today’s post is going detail my most worn clothing items. The first clothing item is the camo sweatpants that are pictured to the right. I thrifted these sweatpants, and they unfortunately have no tag. I have searched the internet up and down for a similar pair, but to no avail. I will update as soon as I can find a dupe. The next item is my Ragged Organic Release Jeans in Charcoal. They are the perfect low rise, super wide leg jeans. Finally, my most worn pair of shoes, my Ugg minis. It can be 90 degrees outside, and I will still be wearing my Uggs. I have definitely gotten my money’s worth from them. That’s all I have for today, stay tuned to upcoming posts. </p>
