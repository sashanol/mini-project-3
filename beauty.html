        <p>For today’s beauty post, I’m going to go over the makeup and skincare products that I will forever be re-purchasing. The first is my all time favorite moisturizer. COSRX’s All in One Snail Mucin is the most hydrating yet lightweight moisturizer I have ever used. Keeping with skincare, the second product is the Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun sunscreen. It is lightweight and doesn’t leave a white cast on the skin. You can never go wrong with Korean skincare. Moving onto makeup, my current favorite blush is the Benetint. It’s so easy to apply with your hands, and it’s the perfect berry color. For mascara, I will forever stand by the Maybelline Sky High. Make sure the get the waterproof version. It’s also super affordable. That’s all I have for today, stay tuned to upcoming posts. </p>
